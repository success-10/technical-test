Server runs at: http://localhost:5000

4. API Documentation
Postman Collection
ðŸ“¥ Download collection (or update with your actual link)


5. How to Test
Import the Postman collection and test each route.

Use the JWT token to access protected routes (/api/retail endpoints).

Test paginated endpoints using ?page=1&limit=10.

6. Design Decisions & Assumptions
Dates are formatted as July 11, 2025 to match UI display expectations.

"Performance" is computed dynamically from latest vs previous price and not stored in the DB to avoid stale data.

Pagination is implemented consistently on search and other routes to retrieve data to improve scalability.

Protect middleware is used to secure all sensitive routes.

Uploaded files can be handled via Cloudinary if needed.

7. API Query Examples
Get filtered data with pagination:

GET /api/retail/search?state=Lagos&product=Petrol&page=1&limit=10

Get product analysis with search:

GET /api/retail/search-product?search=AGO&page=1&limit=10
